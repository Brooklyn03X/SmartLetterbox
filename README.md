# Smart Letterbox

## Description

The **Smart Letterbox** is an IoT-based system designed to enhance the convenience and security of mail delivery. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, a Grove Ultrasonic Sensor, and ThingSpeak for data visualization, this project detects the presence of new mail and sends real-time email notifications to the user. This eliminates the need for manual checks, ensuring that users are promptly informed of any new deliveries.
